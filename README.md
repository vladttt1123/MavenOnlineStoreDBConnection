This is the mini project I've completed as part of self education. 

1. I created a MySQL Database on a local machine, added tables, relations and added entities to each table. 
2. Connected to the Database by implementing Connection Pool data access pattern.
3. For each table in the Database I created a corresponding class in the Model section.
4. DAO layer was implemented to isolate the application layer. 
5. Defined  SQL Queries in EmployeesJDBC  to perform basic CRUD Operations with Employees Class.
6. Learned how to use MyBatis persistence framework, defined mybatis-configuration.xml file and for
each class created an xml file where I defined SQL Queries for basic CRUD Operations and mapped them to the Interfaces in the DAO Layer. 
7.Familiarised with marshalling/unmarshalling jaxb/jackson and represented objects of a class in xml/json formats.
